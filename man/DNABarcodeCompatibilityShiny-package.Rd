\title{DNABarcodeCompatibilityShiny: 
A web app to find optimised sets of compatible barcodes with least 
heterogeneity in barcode usage for multiplex
experiments performed on next generation sequencing platforms.}
\description{
The DNABarcodeCompatibility package provides six functions to load DNA 
barcodes, and to generate, filter and optimise sets of barcode combinations 
for multiplex sequencing experiments.
In particular, barcode combinations are selected to be compatible with 
respect to Illumina chemistry constraints, and can be filtered to keep those
that are robust against substitution and insertion/deletion errors 
thereby facilitating the demultiplexing step.
In addition, the package provides an optimiser function to further favor
the selection of compatible barcode combinations with least 
heterogeneity in barcode usage.
